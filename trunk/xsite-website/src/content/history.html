    <p>The core of XSite grew out of the website generation code originally written by Joe Walnes for XStream project.
    We felt there was a need for this type of tool, that could benefit many other projects.

    <p>XSite provides cleaner separation between interfaces and implementation and made the instantiation completely configurable
    using Pico/NanoContainer. XSite also provides several deployment options, from standalone to a Maven 2 plugin.
