    <h2>Which JDK is required to use XSite?</h2>
    <p>1.5 or later.</p>

    <h2>What is required to use XSite as a standalone application?</h2>
    <p>Only the JDK.  Simply <a href="download.html">download</a> the binary distribution and unzip somewhere on your local filesystem.  
    	   The binary scripts are in the <code>bin/</code> directory, which should be added to the system path.</p>

    <h2>Can I use XSite via Ant or Maven plugin?</h2>
    <p>Yes, see <a href="plugins.html">plugins</a> for more details.</p>

    <h2>What is the required input to use XSite</h2>
    <p>The user must specify a sitemap, a skin and an output directory, see <a href="getting-started.html">getting started</a> for more details.</p>

    <h2>What is the sitemap used for?</h2>
    <p>The sitemap specifies the content of the website, see <a href="sitemap.html">sitemap</a> for more details.</p>

    <h2>What is the skin used for?</h2>
    <p>The skin is the template of the website pages, both in terms of layout and of style, see <a href="skin.html">skin</a> for more details.</p>

    <h2>Can I avoid copying SCM files from resource directories?</h2>
    <p>By default, XSite is only "SVN-aware", ie only ".svn" directories are ignored when copying resources.
    If you need to configure different SCM files to be ignored, you can customise XSite to use a bespoke implementation
    of FileSystem, eg by extending default CommonsFileSystem and overriding the <code>IOFileFilter getFileFilter()</code> method. 
    See <a href="custom.html">customising XSite</a> for more details </p>
