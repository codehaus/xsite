	<p>A brief (!?!) history of a website generate tool ... as handed down from generation to generation :-)
	</p>

	<p>
Once upon a time, there was a mock objects library called DynaMock
written by Nat, living on <a href="http://mockobjects.com">mockobjects.com</a>.	
	</p>

	<p>
Along came Joe, and decided to fork in an attempt to rebrand and ditch
the legacy. And so <a href="http://jmock.org">jMock</a> war born. 
Joe didn't actually do much code, he just forked Nat's code and launched the new jMock
website. Joe didn't even do that very well and because he was feeling
so lazy he used Maven to create a very bad and unusable website.
	</p>	


	<p>
Meanwhile, Nat was doing great things with jMock but hated the
website. So he spent some time analysing user requirements for
building a more useful website and came up with a new design.

Nat built this site upon some little Ruby scripts called skinner.rb
and xemplate.rb (found <a href="http://fisheye.codehaus.org/browse/jmock/jmock/website">here</a>). 
This was a few years ago.

And the result is the <a href="http://jmock.org">jMock website</a>.
	</p>	

	<p>
Along came Joe (again!) and really liked the look and navigation of the jMock
website and wanted a similar thing for his new project XStream.
However, for ego stroking reasons ;) , thought it could be done pretty
easily as a 'mashup' between two of his existing opensource projects.
So Joe reimplemented it in Java using SiteMesh and XStream. He called
it MiniMesh (historians will be able to uncover the original code 
<a href="http://svn.xstream.codehaus.org/browse/xstream/trunk/xstream-website">here</a>).

And the result was the current <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org">XStream website</a>. --- uhmm ... 
starting to look familiar?	
	</p>
	
	<p>
Not long after, Dan was also looking for a website for his opensource
project, jBehave. He liked Ruby and grabbed Nat's scripts.

And the result is the  <a href="http://jbehave.codehaus.org/">jBehave website</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>
Meanwhile, Nat was making lots of improvements to his scripts, but Joe
and Dan were missing out.

A little later, Dan started another opensource project, ProxyToys.
J&ouml;rg stepped up and drove it. Coincidentally, J&ouml;rg had also been
driving XStream so he took Joe's fork of Nat's website and used that.

And the result is the <a href="http://proxytoys.codehaus.org/">ProxyToys website</a>
	</p>

	<p>
Wait a minute! J&ouml;rg and Mauro (who was also driving XStream) noticed a
lot of forking and duplication going on.

So they created XSite, which was a fork of Joe's Java fork of Nat's Ruby code.

This was a tool people could use to build similar sites.

And the result is the  <a href="http://xsite.codehaus.org/">XSite website</a>
	</p>

	<p>
Meanwhile, Shane, who was involved with jBehave, had a similar idea
and forked Dan's fork of Nat's fork and worked into his BuildMaster
project:

And the result is the  <a href="http://buildmaster.rubyforge.org/">BuildMaster website</a>
