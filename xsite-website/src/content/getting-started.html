    <h1>Installing standalone XSite</h1>

    <p><a href="download.html">Download</a> XSite and unzip archive to your local filesystem, eg <code>~/xsite</code>, which 
    will thereafter be refered as <code>XSITE_HOME</code>.  It is also useful to add <code>XSITE_HOME/bin</code> to your system path.
    On UNIX systems, ensure that you have the correct permissions to execute <code>bin/xsite.sh</code>.</p>
    
    <h1>Using XSite</h1>

	<p>The required inputs for XSite are 
	
	<ul>
		<li>sitemap.xml: specifies the content of the website and the navigation.  
		The content files refered to in the sitemap are assumed to be in the same directory as the sitemap.</li>
		<li>skin.html: specifies the template and style used by XSite</li>
		<li>output directory: specifies the directory where the generated files will be written to.</li>
	</ul>

	To generate site, simply execute (assuming xsite.sh is in system path, else use full path XSITE_HOME/bin/xsite.sh).
<div class="Source"><pre>
xsite.sh [path-to-sitemap] [path-to-skin] [output-directory]
</pre></div>    	
	Executing script without arguments will also result in a usage message.
	</p>
